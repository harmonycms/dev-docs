# RoutingBundle

> The RoutingBundle integrates dynamic routing into HarmonyCMS using the Symfony CMF Routing component . See the [_component documentation_](https://symfony.com/doc/master/cmf/components/routing/introduction.html) if you are interested in the implementation details of the services explained in this chapter.

This bundle is forked from the Symfony CMF RoutingBundle. This documentation will only list the custom features who differ from the forked bundle. See the [Symfony CMF RoutingBundle documentation](https://symfony.com/doc/master/cmf/bundles/routing/index.html) for know more.

{% hint style="warning" %}
This bundle is forked from [Symfony CMF RoutingBundle](https://packagist.org/packages/symfony-cmf/routing-bundle) but drop the support of PHPCR-ODM.
