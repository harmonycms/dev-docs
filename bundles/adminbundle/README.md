# AdminBundle

HarmonyCMS do not provide by default an admin interface. If the end user is intent to use one, it will need to bind this package \(bundle\) [harmony/admin-bundle](https://marketplace.harmonycms.net/package/harmony-admin-bundle) to his project directly from the HarmonyPlatform Marketplace.

This bundle provide an admin interface, forked from [EasyAdminBundle](https://packagist.org/packages/easycorp/easyadmin-bundle), updated with new features such as:

* Dashboard interface,
* Pre-configured menus powered by [KnpMenuBundle](https://packagist.org/packages/knplabs/knp-menu-bundle) and [ConfigKnpMenuBundle](https://packagist.org/packages/converia/config-knp-menu-bundle), using YAML files for configuration,
* Config files changed from XML to YAML,
* Services autowiring,
* Update interface,
* Theme management interface,
* Extensions management interface,
* And more...
