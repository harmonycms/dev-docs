# Chapter 1. Installation

We assume youâ€™re familiar with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org), a dependency manager for PHP. Use the following command to add the bundle to your **composer.json** and download the package.

```bash
composer require harmony/core-bundle
```

> Alternatively, you can clone the [https://github.com/harmonycms/core-bundle](https://github.com/harmonycms/core-bundle) repository.
