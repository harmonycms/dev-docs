# The Routing System

HarmonyCMS embed the bundle [RouteAutowiringBundle](https://packagist.org/packages/rollerworks/route-autowiring-bundle) who provide a routing **slot** feature.  
With the help of this bundle, we separate all routes in 2 distinct slots.  
One for the frontend \(named `main`\) and one for the admin area \(named `admin`\).
