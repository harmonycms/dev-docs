# Chapter 1. Structure

The directory structure of a theme is meant to help to keep code consistent between all HarmonyCMS themes. It follows a set of conventions, but is flexible to be adjusted if needed.  
Here is its organization, which is explained further below.

```text
harmony
└── acme-theme
     ├── assets
     │   ├── css
     │   │   └── main.css
     │   ├── images
     │   ├── javascripts
     │   └── preview.jpg
     ├── base.html.twig
     ├── composer.json
     ├── HarmonyAcmeTheme.php
     ├── index.html.twig
     ├── settings.yaml
     └── translations
          └── acme-theme.en.xlf
```
