# Your first theme

In this documentation, we will cover how to build your first theme for HarmonyCMS.  
If you're a beginner, you're in the right place. We're going to keep it simple and construct a theme one template at a time. The theme won't be pretty, but will provide you with enough foundation to start flying on your own.

An HarmonyCMS theme is composed **template files**, **assets**, **settings** and **menus**.
