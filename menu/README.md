# Menu

Menu system covers the basic tasks a user may carry out when building menus.  
Menus are powered and managed by [KnpMenuBundle](https://packagist.org/packages/knplabs/knp-menu-bundle) who integrates the [KnpMenu](https://github.com/KnpLabs/KnpMenu) PHP library with Symfony.  
[HarmonyMenuBundle](https://packagist.org/packages/harmony/menu-bundle) on top of KnpMenuBundle add new features, such as:

* Separate business logic and menu rendering,
* Configuration with YAML files,
* Store menu items in a database.
